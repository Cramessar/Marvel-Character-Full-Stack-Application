🦸‍♂️ Marvel Character API Web App 🦸‍♀️
Where Code Meets Superpowers!

🔥 Project Overview
Welcome to the Marvel Character API Web App, where heroes and villains come to life! We took raw, unstructured data, gave it a spandex suit, and turned it into a sleek, database-driven character management system.

This project started simple: "Let’s fetch some Marvel characters." Then, things got out of control. Now, we have:

Database-powered character storage 📦
A Flask backend that refuses to break 💪
A React frontend with so much polish, Stark Industries called us ✨
Dynamic character search & filtering 🔍
Custom styling that makes your screen feel like it’s in the MCU 🎬
If you ever wanted to store, view, filter, add, edit, and delete Marvel characters while feeling like Tony Stark writing J.A.R.V.I.S., this is the app for you!

🛠 Tech Stack
This project is powered by the Infinity Gauntlet of modern web technologies:

🌐 Frontend (React + Bootstrap)
React Router – Because superheroes need smooth navigation
React Bootstrap – Because regular CSS wasn’t fancy enough
Axios – Fetching data like Doctor Strange fetching timelines
Custom CSS – Tailored to perfection, because design matters
🖥 Backend (Flask + SQLAlchemy)
Flask – The heart of our API, pumping JSON responses faster than Quicksilver
SQLAlchemy – Manages our database like Professor X manages the X-Men
Marshmallow – Serializing data like it's casting a spell
🗄 Database (MySQL)
Persistent character storage – Your characters aren’t disappearing into the multiverse
Smart duplicate prevention – Loki can only be added once!
🔥 Additional Features
Wikipedia API Integration – Fetches details on characters automatically
CORS Handling – So browsers don’t get mad at our API
Validation & Error Handling – Because even superheroes make mistakes
🚀 Features
🦸‍♂️ Character Management
✔️ View all Marvel characters (in an elegant, responsive grid)
✔️ Search characters by name (because nobody has time to scroll forever)
✔️ Filter by heroes or villains (choose wisely)
✔️ Pagination (because loading everything at once is so 2005)

📝 Character Actions
✔️ Add new characters with name, alias, alignment, powers, and an image
✔️ Edit character details (because Thanos snapped some typos)
✔️ Delete characters (goodbye, Uncle Ben… again)

🎨 Styling & UX
✔️ Marvel Cinematic Universe-themed design (complete with gradients and glowing effects)
✔️ Dynamic hover animations (smooth like Spider-Man swinging through NYC)
✔️ Highlighting active navbar links (so you always know where you are)
✔️ Custom 404 page featuring Deadpool (because breaking the fourth wall is mandatory)

🛡 Backend Power-ups
✔️ Flask-based API with full CRUD operations
✔️ Error handling for bad requests & invalid data
✔️ Prevents duplicate entries (No two Lokis in this timeline)
✔️ Wikipedia API integration for fetching character lore
